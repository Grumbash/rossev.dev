# rossev.dev

Source for my personal site, [rossev.dev](https://rossev.dev).

Everything about me lives in one file, `src/data/profile.ts`. The site, the PDF CV (`public/gleb-rosev-cv.pdf`), `/llms.txt` and the OG card are all generated from it, so they can't drift apart. Change a date there and it changes everywhere on the next build.

`/llms.txt` is the same profile as plain Markdown, for people who read the site through an AI assistant.

Built in two evenings with Gemini Argon. Astro 5, TypeScript, HTMX for the partials, a small hand-written canvas engine for the 3D topology (`src/scripts/iso-engine.ts`). Hosted on Vercel.

## Run it

```bash
bun install
bun dev          # local dev server
bun run build    # regenerates CV, llms.txt and OG card, then builds the site
```

`bun run generate:cv` regenerates the CV, `llms.txt` and OG card without building the site.
